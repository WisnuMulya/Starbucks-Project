# Starbucks Project: Predicting Response to Promotional Offers

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repo contains a personal project on building a machine learning model to
predict response of simulated Starbucks customers, which are based on real data.
The dataset is provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)  and Starbucks as
a resource for a capstone project for Machine Learning Nanodegree program they host.

## Instalation
1. Make sure Anaconda is installed: [https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/).
2. Make sure the following Python packages are installed to run the notebook:
   * Python 3
   * Pandas
   * Numpy
   * Matplotlib
   * Seaborn
   * Scikit Learn

## Project Motivation
In this project, I am interested in building a machine learning model that could
predict customers response from a promotional offer based on their attributes and
also based on the offer's attributes.

## File Descriptions
The project is lay out in the Jupyter Notebook file here: `Starbucks Capstone Project.ipynb`.
